A light and fluffy texture, but not excessively tall.

## Ingredients

### North Dakota Caramel Rolls

- 1 pkg rapid rise active dry yeast
- ½ cup sugar
- ½ cup shortening
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 6 cups bread flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp baking soda

### Caramel Sauce

- 3 cups brown sugar
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 Tbs light corn syrup
- 2-4 Tbs butter unsalted butter, softened or melted
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 3 Tbs white sugar

## Directions

### North Dakota Caramel Rolls

1. Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup of water. In a large standing mixer, cream sugar and shortening. Add buttermilk, yeast mixture, 2 cups flour, salt, baking powder and soda. Beat until smooth. Stir in remaining 4 cups of flour to make a very soft dough (I did this part with my mixer's bread hook). Turn onto a floured surface and knead 4-8 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
2. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes while you make the caramel sauce.

### Caramel Sauce

1. Combine brown sugar, cream and light corn syrup in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until sugar is dissolved & sauce is slightly thickened. Pour caramel sauce in equal amounts in the bottom of two 9x13 pans. [I usually get 12-14 rolls out of one batch. In order to avoid crowding, don't place more than 6-7 rolls in each pan.]
2. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a large 10x18 inch rectangle. Spread with the softened butter. Sprinkle cinnamon & sugar over the dough. Starting with the long side, roll up and press to seal. Cut into 1" thick slices.
3. Place the rolls on top of the caramel sauce in your 2 pans. Cover with a bread cloth & let rise near your warming oven until doubled in size - about 1-2 hours. Bake in preheated 375° oven for 25-30 minutes. Invert onto platter while rolls are still warm.
